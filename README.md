# TextEdit

Messenger Chat/Text Editor


Web application:
  -Multiple workspaces allowed, much like group me/slack
  -Different workspaces will not affect other workspaces
  -Messenger will work as a text messenger in the beginning(Will need to expand to photos and videos later)
  -Multifuctional messenger, built more toward programmers expert and beginners
  
Built in text editor:
  -Will only be able to use friendly languages at the start (HTML, CSS, JavaScript)
  -After will be able to use other languages(maybe C, C++, Python, Java, etc)
  -Files will be stored in a folder that will be will automatically have the same name as your current workspace
  -Overall download folder will be labeled with name of site 
  -(Ex. if site is named "TextEdit", Folder in computer download will be named TextEdit)
  -Workspaces will automatically be updated if you save them(under same name)
  
File save/control:
  -Files will be saved directly on your computer(if downloaded already)
  -But you will be able to turn off this function if you want to have more version control
  -Maybe be able to connect to a git repository if you want a certain file to be saved in there rather than in your files directly

Terminal(?):
  -Terminal can be used to running the code you wrote(Start small, implement a few different languages then branch out)
  -Either built directly in with the text editor or have it as a seperate entity that reads from folder saved on computer
  -For example, if you have a workspace named "project1", terminal in workspace "project1" will be open 
  -Folder named "project1" inside your computer will be where the terminal reads from, terminal cannot work with folders outside "project1"
